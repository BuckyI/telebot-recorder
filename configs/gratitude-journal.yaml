  Gratitude journaling focuses on what you are grateful for, not what you need to do or record what happened.

  - A run around Floridaâ€™s Fisher Island with a slight breeze that kept me cool;
  - Eating cold melon on a bench in the sun;
  - A long and hilarious chat with Gayle about her blind date with Mr. Potato Head;
  - Sorbet in a cone, so sweet that I literally licked my finger;
  - Maya Angelou calling to read me a new poem (Winfrey, n.d.).
